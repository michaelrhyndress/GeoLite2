GeoLite2
=====================

This is a simple web API that echoes out latitude and longitude information for a given IP. The API takes a single IPv4 Address parameter and utilizes the  maxmind GeoLite2 database to output a JSON blob of the geolocation information.  

The "server" container fetches the latest GeoLite2 db upon creation and serves a light weight API that queries it. A cron job runs every Wednesday to update the GeoLite2 db.  

There is a "client" container that is serving a React app with Nginx which has a simple search bar that sends a request to the API endpoint.  

DEV
-------

To run everything:  
    (DEV) `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up --build -d`  
    (PROD) `docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up --build -d`  
  
To run a specific container:  
    ```
    cd ./client  
    docker build -f Dockerfile.dev -t client-dev .  
    docker run -p 80:80 client-dev
    ```

TESTING
-------
The client utilizes the default React testing framework that runs when running docker-compose. The results can be found in the console upon starting the container.  
  
The backend api can be tested by running docker-compose to start a local server and executing:  
    ```
    npm install mocha -g  
    cd ./server  
    mocha
    ```


Deploy
-------
    
    docker build -t mrhyndress/geoip2-client:latest ./client  
    docker push mrhyndress/geoip2-client:latest  
  
    docker build -t mrhyndress/geoip2-server:latest ./server  
    docker push mrhyndress/geoip2-server:latest  
  
    kubectl apply -f deploy.yaml

Usage
-------

You must have docker, kubectl, docker-compose, node, and npm locally.  
GET request to http://localhost:8081?ip={{ IPv4 Address }}  
Front end client: http://localhost:80  


Troubleshooting
-------

IF:  
    ```Bind for 0.0.0.0:80 failed: port is already allocated.```
THEN:  
    ```
    kubectl delete all --all  
    docker stop $(docker ps -aq)  
    docker rm $(docker ps -aq)
    ```
